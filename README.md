# CarePartners Interactive Donor Map

<img src="readme_images/carepartners_map_preview.png">

This Flash-based **Dash** app was designed for CarePartners, a Houston nonprofit serving people with dementia and their caregivers. Using **Pandas** and **Plotly**, over **21,000+ donor records** are analyzed and displayed in an interactive choropleth map of Texas. Various filters can be applied to show important trends in giving. CarePartners staff have the ability to upload new data through the interface due to the application's connection to **MongoDB**.
